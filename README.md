</p>

So your objective is to fight against this monster with your chosen art painting.

You can choose your character among three paintings available: 

- The Kiss [Gustav Klimt]
- The Lovers [Rene Magritte]
- Death and Live [Gustav Klimt]

Since our boss has much more HP and Damage than you, in order to compensate that, you have 40% chance of landing a critical attack on monster (doubling it's attack damage).
Random Number is generated in solidity using `block.difficulty` and `block.timestamp`.
